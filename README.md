## Abstract
This study investigates the phenomenon of voter apathy among Nigerian youth concerning the 2019 presidential election. Utilizing primary survey data collected six weeks prior to the election, the research highlights a significant disconnect between preferred candidates and perceived winners, coupled with a low propensity to vote even among those with voter registration cards. The findings suggest that voter apathy is likely driven by a combination of insufficient civic education regarding the impact of individual votes and a pervasive distrust in the electoral process. This paper also contextualizes these findings within broader democratic principles and the unique electoral landscape of many African nations.

## 1. Introduction
In established democracies, the electoral process serves as a fundamental mechanism for citizens to effect political change. Regular opinion polls in countries like the United States reflect public sentiment, with voters often aligning their choices with a candidate's manifesto, credibility, and the ruling party's performance during its tenure [1]. Key indicators of a healthy democracy include a strong belief among citizens that their vote counts and a willingness to utilize their franchise to either retain or replace a government [2]. However, this ideal scenario often contrasts sharply with the realities observed in many African nations, where electoral participation patterns can diverge significantly [3].

Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has a significant youth demographic that is critical to its political future. Understanding their engagement with the electoral process is paramount. This paper aims to analyze the extent and potential drivers of voter apathy among Nigerian youth in the lead-up to the 2019 presidential election.

## 2. Literature Review and Context
Voter apathy, generally defined as a lack of interest or concern about elections, is a widespread challenge in many emerging democracies. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, including disillusionment with political parties, a perception that votes do not count, lack of trust in electoral institutions, and socio-economic challenges [4, 5].

In Nigeria, the youth population (defined by the National Youth Policy as individuals aged 18-35) constitutes a significant proportion of the electorate. Historically, youth participation in Nigerian elections has been a mixed bag, often characterized by periods of intense mobilization alongside considerable disengagement [6]. The period leading up to the 2019 general elections saw various campaigns aimed at encouraging youth participation. However, concerns about the credibility of the electoral process and the impact of vote-buying have persisted [7, 8].

According to data from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) prior to the 2019 elections, a substantial number of young Nigerians had registered to vote. As of late 2018, INEC reported that individuals aged 18-35 constituted a significant portion of registered voters. While exact breakdowns by age and gender for voter card possession are often granular and subject to change, general trends indicated that youth voter registration was high, yet concerns about actual turnout remained [9, 10]. Specifically, INEC's pre-election statistics showed that approximately **51% of registered voters were between 18 and 35 years old**. However, precise figures for *possession* of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) within this demographic, broken down by gender, were not consistently and widely disseminated in detailed public reports prior to the election itself, beyond general registration numbers [11]. The focus was often on total registration and PVC collection rates, with youth representing the largest demographic group in both categories.

## 3. Objective
The primary objective of this study is to analyze the voter apathy amongst Nigerian youths in the context of the 2019 presidential election.

## 4. Methodology and Data

### 4.1. Data Source
This study utilized primary data collected through a Google Forms survey.

### 4.2. Sample Size
The survey gathered responses from **108 individuals**.

### 4.3. Data Collection Period
Data was collected approximately **six weeks prior** to the 2019 presidential election.

### 4.4. Analysis Method
Descriptive statistics were employed to analyze the collected data, focusing on frequencies and percentages to identify key trends and insights.

### 4.5. Sampling Method and Limitations
Due to the challenges in reaching a large and diverse community, a **convenient sampling method** was employed. This approach meant that respondents were predominantly clustered in the Western regions of Nigeria, with limited representation from the North and a handful from the East. This geographical skew introduces a significant sampling bias, limiting the generalizability of the findings to the entire Nigerian youth population. Furthermore, the limited sample size (N=108) means that the sample may not be fully representative of the diverse demographics and political sentiments of Nigerian youth.

## 5. Analysis and Discussion

### 5.1. Preferred Candidates vs. Perceived Winners
The survey revealed a notable disparity between the candidates preferred by Nigerian youth and those they believed would ultimately win the presidential election:
*   **Most Preferred Candidate:** Fela Durotoye 33% (almost twice as much preference as the Atiku who about 40% of total respodent believe will emerge winner)
*   **Second Most Preferred:** Muhammadu Buhari with 21%
*   **Third Most Preferred:** Atiku Abubakar (18.5% of respondents)

However, when asked who they thought would emerge winner:
*   Only **9%** believed Durotoye would win.
*   **43.5%** were bullish about Buhari winning.
*   **37%** perceived Atiku Abubakar as the second most likely winner.

This stark contrast highlights a significant disconnect: while youth may have a clear preference for alternative candidates, they do not necessarily believe these candidates can win. This perception of futility can be a potent driver of apathy.

### 5.2. Voter Card Possession and Intent to Vote
The survey also investigated voter card possession and voting intentions among the respondents:
*   **47%** of respondents claimed to possess a Permanent Voter Card (PVC), while **53%** did not.
*   Of those who possessed a PVC, only **60.8%** expressed an intention to vote, while **39.2%** did not intend to vote.
*   Cumulatively, the total percentage of non-voting youths among the surveyed population was approximately **70%** (combining those without PVCs and those with PVCs but no intention to vote).

### 5.3. Implications of the Findings
The results clearly imply a high degree of voter apathy among the surveyed Nigerian youth entering the 2019 elections. This analysis suggests two primary, potentially interconnected, underlying reasons:

1.  **Lack of Civic Education and Belief in Vote Efficacy:** The high percentage of preferred candidates who are not perceived as winners, coupled with the low intention to vote, could indicate that many youths lack a clear understanding of how their collective votes can influence election outcomes. The video associated with this study aimed to address this by illustrating that collective action at the ballot box could indeed lead to their preferred candidate's victory.
2.  **Distrust in the Electoral Process:** The significant gap between preferred candidates and perceived winners strongly suggests a distrust in the election system itself. If youths believe the electoral process is rigged or that their votes will not genuinely count, they are less likely to participate, regardless of their candidate preferences. This lack of trust is a pervasive issue in many emerging democracies and can be exacerbated by past electoral irregularities or perceptions of systemic bias [12].

## 6. Limitations and Recommendations

### 6.1. Limitations
As previously noted in the methodology section, the study is subject to two main limitations:
1.  **Sampling Method:** The convenient sampling method resulted in a geographical bias, with a concentration of respondents from the Western regions. This limits the generalizability of the findings to the diverse youth population across all of Nigeria.
2.  **Sample Size:** The relatively small sample size (N=203) further constrains the representativeness of the sample, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions for the entire national youth demographic.

### 6.2. Recommendations
Based on the insights from this study, the following recommendations are put forth:
1.  **Targeted Civic Education Campaigns:** There is a critical need for comprehensive and engaging civic education campaigns specifically tailored for young people. These campaigns should focus on demystifying the electoral process, emphasizing the power of collective votes, and building confidence in the democratic system.
2.  **Electoral Reform and Transparency:** Efforts to enhance the transparency and credibility of the electoral process are crucial. This includes strengthening electoral institutions, ensuring timely and accurate results, and addressing issues like vote-buying and electoral violence, which erode public trust.
3.  **Youth Engagement Initiatives:** Political parties and civil society organizations should develop more effective strategies to engage youth beyond rhetoric, involving them in policy discussions and demonstrating how their participation can lead to tangible outcomes.
4.  **Future Research:** Future studies should employ more robust sampling methodologies (e.g., stratified random sampling) and larger sample sizes to ensure broader representation and enhance the generalizability of findings across Nigeria's diverse regions and demographics.

## 7. Conclusion
The 2019 Nigerian presidential election was marked by significant voter apathy among the youth, as evidenced by this study. Despite having clear preferences for certain candidates, a substantial portion of young Nigerians did not intend to vote, largely due to a perceived futility of their ballots and a potential distrust in the electoral system. Addressing this apathy requires a multi-faceted approach involving enhanced civic education, electoral reforms to bolster transparency and credibility, and genuine efforts to engage youth in the political process. The future of Nigerian democracy heavily relies on the active and informed participation of its largest demographic – the youth.
